==================================
This sections gives examples on how to use the three modes of TandemMod.

Train m6A model using IVET m6A dataset
********************
IVET datasets have been uploaded to GEO database under the accession number GSE227087. To train a m6A detection model, the followinng two fast5 files (m6A-modified and unmodified) are required::

    IVET_DRS_unmodified.tar.gz 
    IVET_DRS_m6A.tar.gz 

In this demo, subsets of the two datasets were taken for demonstration purposes due to the large size of the original datasets.
